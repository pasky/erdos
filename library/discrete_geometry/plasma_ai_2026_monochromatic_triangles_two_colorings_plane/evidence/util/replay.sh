# Rebuild Plasma AI's Problem 173 formalization at its own pinned toolchain, check its five
# theorems with Comparator, and replay them in the Lean kernel from an empty environment: the
# procedure the receipt in ../verify/ records.
#
# usage: replay.sh WORKDIR [fetch|check]
#   WORKDIR  a scratch folder outside the repository. It receives the extracted tree and its build,
#            Comparator and lean4export, and a clone of the source repository for the comparison:
#            several GB beside the Mathlib cache, which lake keeps in its own cache folder.
#   fetch    the steps that need the network. Extract ../assets/erdos_173_formalization.tar.gz
#            into a fresh folder; compare it with a fresh `git archive` of the pinned commit,
#            reporting and never refusing a difference; fetch the toolchain, Mathlib and its cache;
#            fetch Comparator and lean4export at the toolchain's tag, with their dependencies.
#   check    the offline steps, under sandbox-exec with ./build.sb on macOS: no network, and writes
#            only to WORKDIR, the temporary folders and lake's and elan's caches. Build Comparator
#            and lean4export; run Comparator with the tree's comparator.json before anything else
#            builds Solution, as Comparator requires; run the Conjectures.io card's Replay.lean on
#            each theorem; print their axioms. Comparator's sandbox, landrun, runs only on Linux;
#            elsewhere its own scripts/fake-landrun.sh stands in, and the run relies on build.sb.
#   With neither, fetch and then check.
# needs: bash, tar, gzip, git and elan, and network access for fetch.
