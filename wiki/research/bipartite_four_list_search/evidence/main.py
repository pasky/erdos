"""Check the order-40 construction and its rigidity under small exchanges.

Checked clauses:

1. The construction of Hanson, MacGillivray and Toft's Theorem 3 for k = 4
   (built here from its recipe) has 16 left and 24 right four-element lists
   on 12 colours, all distinct, covering every pair of colours, and is bad:
   each of the 4096 palette subsets misses a left list or contains a right
   list.
2. Every list is essential: deleting any one list leaves a palette subset
   meeting every left list and containing no right list, which is exhibited
   and checked as a proper colouring of the complete bipartite graph.
3. Positive control of the exchange search: after deleting any one list,
   the only single four-subset (on either side) whose addition restores
   badness is the deleted list.
4. Deleting any r of the 40 lists and adding at most r-1 signed four-subsets,
   for r = 2,3,4 (and r = 5 in the full run), never gives a bad assignment.
   Every deletion set is enumerated; explicit checked colour permutations
   reduce them to orbits. The search over added lists is exhaustive: an
   uncovered subset must be covered by one of them. No restriction on the
   sides of the added lists, pair coverage, or global distinctness is imposed.

Run from the repository root:
    uv run --no-sync python wiki/research/bipartite_four_list_search/evidence/main.py

Dependencies: numpy and the installed root ``tools`` package. No inputs or
output files; deterministic. The full run takes about two minutes, and quick
mode a few seconds. ``--quick`` checks clauses 1 to 3 and exchanges
through 4-for-3; the full run also checks 5-for-4 and has a ten-minute internal
deadline. An exhausted deadline is failure, not an exclusion. Every
failed obligation exits nonzero, including under ``python -O``. Limitation:
the exchanges explore one neighbourhood of one construction on its own 12
colours; they say nothing about bad assignments of order 39 elsewhere.
