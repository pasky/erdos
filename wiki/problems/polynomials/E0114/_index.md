# Problem 114

[[problems/polynomials/_index|..]]

[[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/_index|claims/]]: The 7 claim pages of Problem 114, one per claimant's result; the problem's standing derives from them.

***

**Statement.** If $p(z)\in\mathbb{C}[z]$ is a monic polynomial of degree $n$
then is the length of the curve $\{ z\in \mathbb{C} : \lvert p(z)\rvert=1\}$
maximised when $p(z)=z^n-1$?

**Status.** Falsifiable. The erdosproblems.com label was FALSIFIABLE (page last
edited 2026-01-23): open, but refutable by a finite counterexample. Seven
partial claims are recorded, and none settles the question. Degree $2$ is
proved twice, by Wang
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/1998_01_01_wang|Wang 1998]], accepted,
refereed) and by Eremenko and Hayman
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/1999_09_01_eremenko_hayman|Eremenko–Hayman 1999]],
accepted, refereed). Tao proves all sufficiently large degrees in an arXiv
preprint ([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2025_12_13_tao|Tao 2025]],
pending). Degree $3$ has three pending claims. No review or acceptance of
Dahlke's or Chatelet's is recorded; Plasma AI's
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_10_19_plasma_ai|Plasma AI 2026]]) has
the independently graded whole-claim examination described under Current
assessment. Dahlke's Zenodo manuscript was announced on the
erdosproblems.com discussion thread on 2026-05-21
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_05_20_dahlke|Dahlke 2026]]).
Chatelet's write-up and Lean development were posted in August 2026 and
registered on the erdosproblems.com proof-claims tab on 2026-09-07
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_08_22_chatelet|Chatelet 2026]]).
Chatelet's claim asserts the cubic case under a domain reduction cited from
Eremenko–Hayman and Tao. Mendoza's computer search claimed degrees $3$ to $14$,
and its author withdrew the claim on 2026-10-01
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_03_23_mendoza|Mendoza 2026]]).

## Current assessment

Bloom's catalog labeled the problem FALSIFIABLE: a single monic polynomial whose
lemniscate is longer than that of $z^n-1$ of the same degree would refute the
conjecture by a finite computation of two lengths. Remark 1.3 of
[[../library/polynomials/tao_2025_maximal_length_erdos_herzog_piranian_lemniscate/_index|Tao 2025]]
adds that the constants of its proof are effective, so the conjecture reduces to
finitely many degrees, and that only an exact tie between the lemniscate lengths
of $z^n-1$ and of a competitor in some bounded degree could keep it from being
decided by a finite computation. The erdosproblems.com remarks record the
question as settled for $n=2$ by Eremenko and Hayman [ErHa99], a case Wang
[Wa98] had proved a year earlier in a paper a comment on the erdosproblems.com
discussion thread pointed to, and for all sufficiently large $n$ by Tao [Ta25],
with $z^n-1$ the unique maximizer up to rotation and translation; each result
settles the instances it names and has its own partial claim page, the first two
accepted on their refereeing
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/1998_01_01_wang|Wang 1998]],
[[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/1999_09_01_eremenko_hayman|Eremenko–Hayman 1999]]),
the third pending as an arXiv preprint
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2025_12_13_tao|Tao 2025]]); because the
erdosproblems.com label was an open one, its remarks are commentary and not
acceptance. The general upper bounds $f(n)\le 2\pi n$ [Da07] and
$f(n)\le 2n+O(n^{7/8})$ [FrNa09] precede Tao's result. Among the external
claims listed here, degrees from $3$ up to Tao's bound lack accepted
coverage; the separate project cubic result is described below. Two pending
external claims treat degree 3, Dahlke's
manuscript ([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_05_20_dahlke|Dahlke 2026]])
and Chatelet's write-up
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_08_22_chatelet|Chatelet 2026]]), the
latter's Lean development at the pinned commit stating its cited reduction as a
hypothesis that is stronger than the cited results and false, so that its formal
theorem holds vacuously (the claim page records the details). Mendoza's
interval-arithmetic search over degrees $3$ to $14$
([[problems/polynomials/E0114/claims/2026_03_23_mendoza|Mendoza 2026]]) was
withdrawn by its author on 2026-10-01, after an objection on its code repository
showed that its lengths and margins were estimates rather than bounds and that
half of the coefficient box was never evaluated for $n\ge6$. A research note on
degree $4$ posted on the thread on 2026-08-10 says itself that it does not solve
that case; it settles no degree and has no claim page. Search scope:
the erdosproblems.com references, its proof-claims tab and its discussion thread
(nine comments, the last of 2026-09-05), the Zenodo records of Dahlke and
Mendoza, the Mendoza repository and its issue #4, Chatelet's Zenodo record and
repository, and the zbMATH record of Wang 1998; no wider literature search is
recorded. This source assessment supplies no independent acceptance of
those external submissions; the project cubic deduction and its retained
whole-claim examination are described below.

**A deduction and its scope.**
[[research/erdos_114/cubic_extremizer_reduction|Cubic extremizers with critical values on the unit circle]] gives the
argument and source boundaries: an existential reduction of a cubic lemniscate
maximizer to a compact real family. The project claim
[[theory/polynomials/L144_cubic_lemniscate_length/_index|L144]] proves the
inequality for that family with a written reduction to explicit integrals and
ball-arithmetic bounds, and with Lemmas 4 and 5 of [ErHa99] and the
deformation in the proof of Lemma 5 deduces that $z^3-1$ maximizes the length
among monic complex cubics and is the only maximizer up to rotation and
translation. Its [independently graded whole-claim examination](../../../theory/polynomials/L144_cubic_lemniscate_length/evidence/verify/_index.md)
warrants tier 1 for this computer-assisted degree-3 result, with the source,
arithmetic and exposure qualifications retained on L144. This argument leaves
the all-degree question open.

For degree four, the
[[research/erdos_114/_index|quartic research account]] combines compact
coordinates, an explicit small-curvature estimate and certified strict
bounds on both collision pencils, all at author-recorded tier 0. Practical
neighborhoods of those pencils and the regular two-dimensional complement
remain unresolved; these results do not establish the full quartic bound.
